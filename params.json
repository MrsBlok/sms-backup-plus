{"name":"Sms-backup-plus","tagline":"Backup Android SMS, MMS and call log to Gmail / Gcal / IMAP","body":"## SMS Backup+\r\n\r\n[![][Icon]][MarketLink]\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jberkel/sms-backup-plus.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jberkel/sms-backup-plus)\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of the Android backup tool\r\n[SMS Backup](http://code.google.com/p/android-sms), where development has\r\nstopped a while ago. It uses Gmail to perform SMS, MMS and call log backups over\r\nthe network.\r\n\r\nMain differences / improvements:\r\n\r\n  * New restore feature. SMS stored on Gmail can be transferred back to the\r\n  phone. This even works for users who have already created their backups with\r\n  older versions of SMS Backup. Note: MMS are currently not restored.\r\n\r\n  * XOAuth: SMS Backup+ will never ask you for your Gmail password. Instead it\r\n  uses [XOAuth](http://code.google.com/apis/gmail/oauth/) to get access to your\r\n  data. You can revoke the access rights at any time.\r\n\r\n  * MMS backup support (since `1.1`), only available on Android 2.x\r\n\r\n  * Call log backup (since `1.2`), with Google Calendar integration (since\r\n  `1.3.`) and restore (since `1.4`).\r\n\r\n  * <a href=\"#whatsapp-support\">WhatsApp message backup</a> (since `1.5.0`)\r\n\r\n  * Batch size limits removed.\r\n\r\n  * Works with any IMAP server (but defaults to Gmail).\r\n\r\nTested with Android 1.5 - 4.2.x.\r\n\r\nSMS Backup+ is available for free in the Google Play Store, there will never be a pro / paid version.\r\n\r\nBut if you find the app useful and want to support the development of it you can make a donation from within the app itself, using the secure Play Store payment mechanism.\r\n\r\nTo get updates and participate in the beta programme join the [community][] on Google+.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"usage\">Usage</a>\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n![MarketQRCode][] Install via the Android QR code link, [Google Play][MarketLink].\r\n\r\n### First steps\r\n\r\nYou need to have an IMAP account or a Gmail account with IMAP enabled. See the\r\n[Enabling IMAP in Gmail][] help page to learn how to enable IMAP for your Gmail\r\naccount or look at this [screenshot][imapenableshot]. If you use Google Apps\r\nmake sure you select \"Sign in with a Google Apps Account\"\r\n([screenshot](http://skitch.com/jberkel/ditwx/5554-emu-2.2)).\r\n\r\nAfter starting SMS Backup+, tap on the \"Connect\" check box to start the\r\nauthorization process.\r\n\r\nOn newer Android devices you'll be presented with a list of gmail accounts to\r\nbe used for the backup. You'll need to give SMSBackup+ the permission to access your\r\nemails.\r\n\r\nOn older devices a browser window will open where Gmail either prompts\r\nyou to log in *or* (if you were already logged in) a screen asking you to give\r\nSMS Backup+ permission to access your emails.\r\n\r\nAfter clicking on \"Grant Access\" SMS Backup+ will become visible again, the\r\ncheckbox should now be checked, indicating that the authorization process was\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n### Upgrading (for users of SMS Backup)\r\n\r\nYou don't need to uninstall the old version in order to try out SMS Backup+.\r\nHowever make sure that \"Auto backup\" is disabled in both apps, otherwise you\r\nmight end up with messages backed up multiple times, resulting in duplicates in\r\nGmail.\r\n\r\nIf you've used SMS Backup before you should just connect your Gmail account as\r\ndescribed above (SMS Backup+ is not able to access login information stored by\r\nSMS Backup). Make sure you select \"Skip\" when asked about the initial sync,\r\notherwise already backed up messages will be backed up again.\r\n\r\n### Initial backup\r\n\r\nIt is important that you perform the first backup manually. SMS Backup+ needs\r\nto know whether you want to upload messages currently stored on your device or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAfter having connected your Gmail account, SMS Backup+ will ask you to perform\r\na first sync. If you choose \"Backup\", SMS Backup+ will start backing up all\r\nyour messages to Gmail.\r\n\r\nIf you choose \"Skip\", nothing is sent to Gmail and all messages currently\r\nstored on your device are simply marked \"backed up\". This option is handy if\r\nyou previously uninstalled SMS Backup+ and do not want to send your messages\r\nagain to Gmail. Please note that any messages arrived after you last\r\nuninstalled SMS Backup and this initial backup won't ever be backed up to\r\nGmail.\r\n\r\nAfter you performed your initial backup, SMS Backup+ is ready to run in the\r\nbackground and finish uploading all of your current and future messages (check\r\n\"Auto Backup\"). Make sure that you have `Background data` enabled in your\r\nAndroid `Accounts & Sync` settings\r\n([screenshot](http://skitch.com/jberkel/d9pi7/5554-emu-2.2)).\r\n\r\n### Restoring\r\n\r\nIf you wish to restore messages back to your phone tap \"Restore\". By default\r\nall messages stored on Gmail will be restored (this can be changed in \"Advanced\r\nSettings\"). You can safely restore to a phone which has already message stored\r\non it, SMS Backup+ will skip the restore of already existing messages.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"call-log-support\">Call log support</a>\r\n\r\nSMS Backup+ can also backup and restore your call logs. It stores all calls using a\r\nseparate label (defaults to `Call log`, but can be changed in Advanced\r\nSettings). If you wish you can set this to the same value as `SMS`, to make all backed\r\nup data use the same label.\r\n\r\nThe body of the call log message contains the duration of the\r\ncall in seconds followed by the phone number and call type (`incoming` /\r\n`outgoing` / `missed`).\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n    267s (00:04:07)\r\n    +44123456789 (incoming call)\r\n\r\nYou can also add call log entries to a Google calendar. Just select `Calendar\r\nsync` in Advanced settings, and make sure you have selected a calendar to sync\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nIf you only want to backup specific call types you can do so as well.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"whatsapp-support\">WhatsApp support</a>\r\n\r\nSMS Backup+ can also transfer your WhatsApp messages to your gmail account.\r\nIn order for this to work you need to make sure to have \"Backup conversations\"\r\nenabled in WhatsApp (Settings - Chat Settings, see [screenshot][whatsapp-screenshot]).\r\n\r\nTo enable the backup in SMS Backup+, go to \"Advanced Settings\",\r\nthen \"Backup Settings\" and tick the \"Backup WhatsApp\" checkbox.\r\n\r\nThe messages will be backed up to the \"WhatsApp\" label in gmail.\r\nNote that WhatsApp messages are backup only, there is no way to restore them.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"3rdparty\">3rd party app integration</a>\r\n\r\nIf you want to trigger backups from another app, enable `3rd party integration`\r\nin Advanced Settings and send the broadcast intent\r\n`com.zegoggles.smssync.BACKUP`. This will work even when Auto Backup is\r\ndisabled.\r\n\r\n### Usage without Gmail (IMAP)\r\n\r\nYou don't have to use Gmail to backup your text messages - change\r\nAuthentication to Plain text in \"Advanced Settings - IMAP server settings\",\r\nthen change the server address / username and password accordingly. Make sure\r\nto set security to \"SSL (Optional)\" if the IMAP server you're connecting to has\r\na self-signed certificate (\"Unknown certificate\" error during backup).\r\n\r\nAlso note that Gmail labels correspond to IMAP folders, which will\r\nautomatically be created the first time you're performing a backup.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"faq\">FAQ</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n### General questions\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-permissions\">Why does it need so many permissions?</a>\r\n\r\n  * Read contacts - Needed to map phone numbers to names and email addresses\r\n  * Your messages (read / write SMS) - Needed for backup+restore\r\n  * Prevent phone from sleeping - needed to keep network active during a backup\r\n  * Modify calendar events - needed for the call log backup to GCal\r\n  * Send email to guests - this refers to calendar invitations (which are not created by the app)\r\n  * Storage (modify/delete SD card contents) - this is needed for caching\r\n  * Find accounts on the device - used for authentication\r\n  * Use accounts on the device - used for authentication\r\n  * Google Play billing service - used for in-app donations\r\n  * Run at startup - used to enable automatic backups after reboot\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-package-not-signed\">When updating the app I get 'Package file was not signed correctly'</a>\r\n\r\nTry uninstalling the app, then installing the new version. Make sure to select\r\n\"Skip\" when doing the first backup, otherwise messages will get backed up\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-file-bug-report\">I want to file a bug report, what should I do?</a>\r\n\r\nFirst check [github issues](https://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus/issues) and see if the bug has already\r\nbeen reported. If not, create a new issue and attach the following details:\r\n\r\n * Version of SMS Backup+ used\r\n * Version of Android / brand of phone used\r\n\r\nIf it is related to backing up / restoring you should also enable the sync log in debug mode (Advanced settings)\r\nand attach a relevant portion of it. The sync log is located on your SD card as \"sms_backup_plus.log\".\r\n\r\nTo attach the sync log create a \"gist\" (https://gist.github.com) and link to the gist you created instead\r\nof posting the full content in the issue.\r\n\r\nIt might also be worth to install the current <a href=\"#beta\">beta</a> version of SMS Backup+ to make sure the\r\nbug has not already been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Backup questions\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-inbox\">Why do backed up SMS show up in my inbox?</a>\r\n\r\nThis is probably related to Gmail's automatic priority inbox filing.\r\nA workaround is to set up a filter with \"subject: SMS with\", let the filter\r\nmark it as not important.\r\n\r\n![](https://img.skitch.com/20120106-tymk3rn4i5apshhr6e1hbd17qn.jpg)\r\n![](https://img.skitch.com/20120106-rsg7912rnus5gwe3e572rxwbae.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-backup-to-inbox\">I want the backed up mesages to show up in my gmail inbox!</a>\r\n\r\nJust set the label to \"Inbox\" instead of the default \"SMS\" or \"Call log\".\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-show-imap\">I get the following Error during backup/restore: Command: SELECT \"SMS\"; response: #6# [NO, Unknown, Mailbox; SMS, [Failure]]</a>\r\n\r\nMake sure you have the \"Show IMAP\" option checked in the Gmail label settings:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot][showimap]\r\n\r\nIf this is the case make sure that the label name is set correctly (capitalization\r\nmatters!).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-reset\">How can I make the app think that it has to do the backup again?</a>\r\n\r\nSelect \"Reset\" from the menu, and confirm that you want to reset the current\r\nsync state. All messages on the phone will be backed up on the next run.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-schedule\">What's the difference between regular and incoming backup schedule?</a>\r\n\r\nIncoming backup schedule is used for incoming messages. 3 minutes here means\r\nthat any incoming SMS will trigger a backup after 3 minutes. It is a full\r\nbackup (including any sent messages). You should set the incoming schedule to a\r\nlow value if you want to make sure that incoming SMS show up in\r\nGmail shortly after arrival.\r\n\r\nRegular schedule is used to perform backups in specific intervals. 2 hours here\r\nmeans that the device will try to backup all messages every 2 hours.\r\n\r\nFewer updates performed by the app means less energy consumed, so there's\r\na trade-off data protection vs. battery life.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-scheduling\">I'd like SMS Backup+ to schedule a backup only at a given time of the day / when Wifi is available / etc.</a>\r\n\r\nIf you require more control over the backup schedule than what SMS Backup+ already\r\nprovides you can use a 3rd party app to trigger the backup. [Tasker][] for\r\nexample supports SMS Backup+ since version 1.0.14.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-gmail-100\">The app saves only 100 SMS/MMS per contact!</a>\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a limitation of Gmail. After the first hundred or so SMS being\r\nbacked up, Gmail will cease to properly thread many of the conversations.\r\nYou will notice that Gmail will eventually treat each SMS (in that initial\r\nbackup) as individual conversations and will not longer group/thread them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nA way around this is to do a full backup 100 SMS at a time (see `Advanced\r\nsettings`).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-threading\">In Gmail, I'd like to have all messages listed chronologically and not ordered by who sent them.</a>\r\n\r\nIt's a Gmail feature, but you can disable it.\r\nIn Gmail settings, set conversation view to `off`\r\n([screenshot][converationviewoff]).\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"faq-delete\"/>\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-does-it-sync\">When I delete a text locally, will it delete the saved copy on gmail?</a>\r\n\r\nNo. SMS Backup+ does not do a \"real\" sync, once the text has been transferred\r\nto Gmail it won't get modified or deleted by the app.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"sms-as-calls\">My messages get backed up as calls!</a>\r\n\r\nThis might be due to some changes in Samsung's version of Android, see [#287](https://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus/issues/287).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"whatsapp-does-not-get-backed-up\">I enabled the WhatsApp backup, but my messages don't get backed up!</a>\r\n\r\nMake sure that you have WhatsApp backups enabled (Settings - Chat Settings, see [screenshot][whatsapp-screenshot]). In\r\nnewer versions of WhatsApp this option will default to \"off\", so you will have to manually enable it.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"whatsapp-group-messages-do-not-get-backed-up\">I enabled the WhatsApp backup, but group messages don't get backed up!</a>\r\n\r\nThis is a current limitation. A future version might address this issue.\r\n\r\n### Restore questions\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-partial-restore\">How do I restore the last N weeks / N messages?</a>\r\n\r\nIf you have a lot of messages backed up (let's say over 5000) restoring can be\r\nvery slow, especially if you're only interested in the most recent messages.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to use the gmail web interface (or an IMAP email client) to\r\nmove the bulk of the messages to another label in gmail (e.g. SMSARCHIVED), and\r\nonly keep a few hundred or so messages in the SMS label.\r\n\r\nNext time you restore it will only restore those messages and it will be a lot\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"restore-reversed\">The timestamps of the restored messages is wrong / the messages are not restored in the right order</a>\r\n\r\nThis is a known bug: [#94](https://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus/issues/94)\r\n\r\n### Authentication questions\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-revoke-access\">How can I revoke SMS Backup+ access</a>\r\n\r\nGo to [Authorized Access to your Google Account][] and select \"Revoke Access\"\r\nnext to \"SMS Backup+\".\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"browser-bug\"/>\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-browser\">After granting access I get the message \"You do do not have permission to open this page\"</a>\r\n\r\nSome browsers / handsets which ship with non-standard browsers are\r\ncurrently not fully supported, there appears to be a problem which breaks\r\nthe authorisation process, so connecting your Gmail account via XOAuth is not\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nSome possible workarounds:\r\n\r\n  * Use the stock Android browser for the authentication (you can switch back\r\n  afterwards)\r\n  * Install a 3rd party browser (Dolphin HD has been reported to work)\r\n  * Use plain text authentication (Advanced Settings - Server Settings), use\r\n  your gmail address as username and supply your password\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-browser\">After granting access, the Messaging app opens.</a>\r\n\r\nSee the answer to the previous question, it's the same problem.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"faq-request-token\">When connecting, I get 'Could not obtain request token...'</a>\r\n\r\nIf you get this error message and your network connection is active\r\ndouble-check that your time zone settings are correct, and that the local time is\r\ndisplaying correctly. The authentication process won't work otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Device specific questions\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"droidx-received\">I'm using a Motorola DROID X/2, and it does not back up incoming messages, only sent!</a>\r\n\r\nIt's a known SMS bug in the latest OTA 2.2 update ([details][droidbug]). As a workaround\r\nyou can try installing [SMS Time fix][] ([apk][smstimefixzip]) and set \"Adjustment Method\" to \"Use Phone's Time\"\r\n([screenshot1][smstimefixshot1], [screenshot2][smstimefixshot2]).\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"beta\">Beta testing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help beta testing, join the [community][] on Google+ and follow the \"Become a beta tester\"\r\nlink in the \"About this community box\". You will be asked to opt in to the beta program (you can leave it at any time).\r\n\r\nOnce opted in your device will automatically update to the latest beta which might have bug fixes and features not found\r\nin the currently released version.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"contributing\">Contributing</a>\r\n\r\n### Installation from source\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus.git\r\n    $ cd sms-backup-plus\r\n    $ mvn install\r\n    $ adb install target/smsbackup-plus-1.x.y-SNAPSHOT.apk\r\n\r\nI've imported some relevant issues from the [original issue list][] to [github issues][].\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"translating\">Translating the UI</a>\r\n\r\nIf you want to help translating the UI to other languages download and\r\ntranslate the following file, then send the translated version via email:\r\n\r\n  * [strings.xml](https://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus/raw/master/res/values/strings.xml)\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're already familiar with Git I'd prefer if you cloned the\r\nrepository and send me a [pull request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/).\r\n\r\n##<a name=\"credits\">Credits</a>\r\n\r\n  * [Christoph Studer](http://studer.tv/) Original author of SMS Backup\r\n  * [Ben Dodson](http://github.com/bjdodson) - Contacts 2.0 / MMS support\r\n  * [Felix Knecht](http://github.com/dicer) - Call log backup code\r\n  * [Michael Scharfstein](http://github.com/smike) - Call log calendar ICS support\r\n  * [k9mail](http://code.google.com/p/k9mail/) IMAP library, with some modifications ([k9mail/sms-backup-plus](http://github.com/jberkel/k9mail))\r\n  * [acra](http://code.google.com/p/acra) ACRA - Application Crash Report for Android\r\n  * [signpost](http://github.com/kaeppler/signpost) Signpost OAuth library\r\n  * Jeffrey F.
